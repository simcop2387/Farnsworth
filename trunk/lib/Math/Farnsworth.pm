=head1 NAME

Math::Farnsworth - A Turing Complete Language for Mathematics

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Math::Farnsworth;
  
  my $hubert = Math::Farnsworth->new();

  my $result = $hubert->runString("10 km -> miles");

  my $result = $hubert->runFile("file.frns");

  print $result;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

THIS IS A BETA RELEASE! There are typos in the error messages and in the POD.  There are also probably plenty of bugs.  It is being released early because there have been a number of people who have shown interest in having it released.  Not every feature is documented yet and a future release will have that cleaned up along with some of the hairier parts of the internal API.
Math::Farnsworth is a programming language originally inspired by Frink (see http://futureboy.homeip.net/frinkdocs/ ).
However due to certain difficulties during the creation of it, the syntax has changed slightly and the capabilities are also different.
Some things Math::Farnsworth can do a little better than Frink, other areas Math::Farnsworth lacks.

=head2 PREREQUISITS

Modules and Libraries you need before this will work

=over 4

=item *

The PARI library

=item *

L<Math::Pari>

=item *

L<Date::Manip>

The following are optional

For the Google Translation library

=item *

L<REST::Google::Translate>

=item *

L<HTML::Entities>

=back

=head2 METHODS

ALL of the methods here call C<die> whenever something doesn't go right.  This means that unless you want bad input to them to cause your program to fail you should wrap any calls to them with C<eval {}>.   When they call C<die> they will give you back a message explaining what went wrong, this is useful for telling a user what they have done.

=head3 runString

This method takes a string (or multiple strings) and executes them as Math::Farnsworth expressions.
For more information on making Math::Farnsworth expressions, see L<Math::Farnsworth::Docs::Syntax>.

=head3 runFile

This takes a file name and executes the entire file as a single Math::Farnsworth expression.

=head3 prettyOut

This takes a Math::Farnsworth::Value and turns it into a string for perl to be able to display.  This method WILL disappear in a future version.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.

=head2 KNOWN BUGS

At the moment all known bugs are related to badly formatted output, this will be rectified in a future release.

=head2 MISSING FEATURES

The following features are currently missing and WILL be implemented in a future version of Math::Farnsworth

=over 4

=item *

Better control over the output

=over 8

=item *

Adjustable precision of numbers

=item *

Better defaults for certain types of output

Passing arguments by reference

=item *

Syntax tree introspection inside the language itself
